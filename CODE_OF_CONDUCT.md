# Starlit Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission

## Forbidden Activities
The following activities are also forbidden when interacting with other members on our community. This includes but not limited to:

* Spamming such as using automated macro/bot
* Mass-mentioning individuals for no reason
* Advertising other communities not related to Roon's Project/Starlit Community
* Using AI-generated prompt to interact with community
  (Excluding the machine-based translation such as Google Translate, DeepL, etc)
* Bumping the issue such as "I have same issue", without providing the information that could be useful for the issue
  (If you have same issue, please use the reaction button instead to show your opinions instead)
* Off-topic comment that is not related to the project
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces(we refer them as 'Starlit Community') of [RoonMoonlight](https://github.com/RoonMoonlight), [QuantuMiz Projects](https://github.com/QuantuMiz), [Deadly Party](https://github.com/DeadlyParty) GitHub repositories,
and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community also include using an social media account.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct, including but not limited to:
* Verbal warning
* Removal of the problematic message
* Access block from the specific or all repositories

Additionally, we reserve the right to temporarily restrict comment/issue access for Roon/collaborators only if necessary.
